# MealApp
A simple web application for storing and searching meals. The app allows users to search for meals, add them to their favorites, view detailed information about each meal, and manage their favorite meals list.

Features
Home Page: Search for meals using the provided search input. Search results will be displayed in real-time as you type, just like Google suggestions. Each search result will have a favorite button to add the meal to your favorites list.

Meal Detail Page: Clicking on a specific search result will open a new page with detailed information about that meal. This page will display the meal's name, photo, instructions, and more.

My Favourite Meals Page: View a list of all your favorite meals. The list is persistent, meaning it will have the same meals even if you close or refresh the browser. Each meal in the list will have a "Remove from favorites" button to easily remove it from the list.

Technologies Used
HTML: The structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS (Bootstrap): Styling and responsiveness of the app.
JavaScript: Implementation of the app's functionality using vanilla JavaScript.
JSONPlaceholder API: Retrieve meal data for searching and displaying meal information.
